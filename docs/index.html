<p>Balance between base-building and exploration: use create to automate
your production and salvage equipment. Hunt out molten vents for
reusable ores. Find curios.</p>
<p>But the world is dangerous every few nights, an undead horde will
attack. The sun won’t stop them, be ready.</p>
<p>Oh and every hit from an undead has a chance to infect you. Without a
golden apple to cure you, the infection means certain death.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Balance your minecraft survival gameplay between base-building,
logistical automation, and exploration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use create to automate your production and salvage equipment</li>
<li>Hunt out molten vents for reusable ores</li>
<li>Find curios</li>
<li>Create a safe outpost</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-overworld-is-a-dangerous-place">The overworld is a dangerous
place</h2>
<p><img src="./images/hiding-in-the-jungle.png" /></p>
<p>But this world is dangerous place. Every few (1-7) nights an undead
horde will attack and try to destroy what you’ve built. Invading forces
will grow stronger over time. The sun won’t stop them so you should be
ready for a long fight.</p>
<p><img src="./images/morning-after.png" /></p>
<h2 id="the-infection">The infection</h2>
<p>Every hit from an undead has a chance to curse you with a zombie
infection. Armor can provide some protection but even a single hit can
be fatal. Without a cure in time, you’ll die and your corpse will
reanimate as a zombie. Without a golden apple, an infection means
certain death.</p>
<p>This infection has hit the other denizens of the world hard. Peaceful
villagers are on the edge of extinction and have rallied their defenses.
Zombie Villagers can’t be cured using conventional mechanics. Even
Illagers aren’t immune must fight off the hordes.</p>
<h2 id="exploration-is-challenging">Exploration is challenging</h2>
<p><img src="./images/boat-in-glacier-near.png" /></p>
<p>The world is not an empty place. Not only do you have to worry about
the undead or if the horde is coming this evening, the overworld itself
is full of danger. The Illagers have established numerous outposts,
bases, and villages. They too have to fight off the infection. While
dangerous, there is also resources to be had in those bases.</p>
<h3 id="varied-worldgen">Varied worldgen</h3>
<p><img src="./images/adventures-on-ice.png" /></p>
<p>There are also dungeons to explore. Loot chests and other resources
make this exploration a constant temptation from riding out the day in
your base.</p>
<h3 id="molten-vents">Molten vents</h3>
<p><img src="./images/molten-vents.png" /></p>
<p>If these resources aren’t enough to get you exploring, search the
overworld for molten vents. They can be found in an outcropping of
asurine, vitrine, ochra, etc. Once you activate the block using an
explosion, a lava source block touching the vent will generate more of
that resource. Grind those resources into ores. Or simply dig to the
bedrock for tuff.</p>
<h2 id="combat-rewards-loot-bags">Combat rewards: loot bags</h2>
<p><img src="./images/legendary-loot-bag.png" /></p>
<p>To help you out further, hostile mobs can drop a loot box that may
drop resources to you with your progression.</p>
<p><img src="./images/loot-bags-are-craftable.png" /></p>
<p>These boxes come in five tiers with better and better loot. Who
knows, you might actually start looking forward to the next
invasion.</p>

<p><img src="./images/zombie-invasion-surrounding.png" /></p>
<p>How many invasions can you survive before becoming overwhelmed?</p>
