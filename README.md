# minecraft-create_vs_zombies

Balance your minecraft survival gameplay between base-building, logistical automation, and exploration.

- Use create to automate your production and salvage equipment
- Hunt out molten vents for reusable ores
- Find curios
- Create a safe outpost

But this world is dangerous place.
Every few (1-7) nights an undead horde will attack and try to destroy what you've built.
Invading forces will grow stronger over time.
The sun wonâ€™t stop them so you should be ready for a long fight.

Every hit from an undead has a chance to infect you with a zombie infection.
Armor can provide some protection from infection, but even a single hit can be fatal.
Without a cure in time, you'll die and your corpse will reanimate as a zombie.
Without a golden apple to cure you an infection means certain death.

This infection has hit the other denizens of the world hard.
Peaceful villagers are on the edge of extinction and have rallied their defenses.
Zombie Villagers can't be cured using conventional mechanics.

Exploration is hard.
The world is not an empty place.
Not only do you have to worry about the undead or if the horde is coming this evening, the overworld itself is full of danger.
The Illagers have established numerous outposts, bases, and villages.
They too have to fight off the infection.
While dangerous, there is also resources to be had in those bases.

There are also dungeons to explore.
Loot chests and other resources make this exploration a constant temptation from riding out the day in your base.

If these resources aren't enough to get you exploring, search the overworld for molten vents.
They can be found in an outcropping of asurine, vitrine, ochra, etc.
Once you activate the block using an explosion, a lava source block touching the vent will generate more of that resource.
Grind those resources into ores.
Or simply dig to the bedrock for tuff.

To help you out further, hostile mobs can drop a loot box that may drop resources to you with your progression.
These boxes come in five tiers with better and better loot.
Who knows, you might actually start looking forward to the next invasion.

How many invasions can you survive before becoming overwhelmed?
